Our expectations were that with few processors and smaller matrices, the naive algorithm would be faster than Strassen’s. As the size of the matrices increased, say beyond 50, or number of processors increased, however, our expectation was that Strassen’s would become faster than the naive algorithm. What we in fact found was that our machines lacked the resources to see Strassen’s overtake the naive algorithm. We simply lacked the time and processing power to continue to the point at which Strassen’s would become the faster choice. Theoretically, with a large dataset and many processors, Strassen’s is the faster option. However, in our application of the algorithms we never made it to the point where Strassen’s was faster. So in this case we may have to say that the naive algorithm is the ‘better’ option.

We expect that with few processors and a small n, the naive algorithm will be faster. But as processors increase in number and n approaches a large number, say 10000, we expect that naive will take much too long. We expect that the naive algorithm will be faster than Strassen's. However, when n is greater than 50 and when we have a larger number of processors, we expect that Strassen's will be the faster of the two algorithms.
